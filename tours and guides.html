                        <p><b>Duration:</b> 3h <br> <b>Meeting point:</b> Praca Luis de Camoes</p>
                        <p>This is a Lisbon Chill-out tour as it was when it all started in 2007. A backpackers' hit ever since, <b>it is a tour without a fixed itinerary</b>, where the walkers and the guide work out a route right before the start.</p>
                        <p>We design this tour by including a more realistic side of Lisbon, let us choose for you and show you why we love our city. Lets step off Rua Augusta, walk through quiet side lanes, peek into small streets smelling like codfish, sample local cafes and shops which we visit and enjoy the city through our eyes of a Lisbon resident.</p>

                        <p>This tour shows a personal and local perspective of Literature through an alternative insight of the city. The Literature Tour is a journey across the works of writers inspired by Lisboa. This includes Portuguese icons like Fernando Pessoa, Eca de Queiroz and Jose Saramago, as well as foreign authors such as Erich Maria Remarque and Antonio Tabucchi.</p>
                        <p>It's not necessary to read any books in order to participate in the tour. You only need a passion for Literature and Art in general.</p>
